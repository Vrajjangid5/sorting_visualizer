# Sorting Visualizer

## Description
Sorting Visualizer is an interactive web application that visually demonstrates various sorting algorithms. This project helps users understand how different sorting algorithms work by providing a dynamic and engaging visualization. The algorithms included are Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort. Users can customize the number of bars and adjust the sorting speed to enhance their learning experience.

## Features
- **Bubble Sort**: Visualizes the bubble sort algorithm with animated bar movements to show how elements are swapped and sorted.
- **Merge Sort**: Demonstrates the merge sort algorithm, highlighting the divide-and-conquer strategy through animated merging steps.
- **Quick Sort**: Illustrates the quick sort algorithm, showcasing the partitioning process and recursive sorting.
- **Selection Sort**: Shows the selection sort algorithm, emphasizing how the smallest (or largest) element is repeatedly selected and placed in the correct position.
- **Insertion Sort**: Visualizes the insertion sort algorithm, demonstrating how elements are gradually inserted into the sorted portion of the array.
- **Dynamic Controls**: Allows users to adjust the number of bars and the sorting speed to customize the visualization according to their preferences.

## Installation Instructions
To set up and run the Sorting Visualizer locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vrajjangid5/sorting_visualizer.git

2.**Navigate to the project directory:**
  ```bash
  cd sorting_visualizer

**Usage Instructions**
Open the application in your web browser.
Use the sliders to adjust the number of bars and the sorting speed.
Select a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu to initiate the visualization.
Observe the sorting process as the bars animate according to the selected algorithm.
